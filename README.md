# What is Pythmon

[Github-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
I am building this package as an alternative to nodejs nodemon package. Currently it sits simply ontop of watchdog, and needs to be shaped into a real pip package.



# What needs to be done

- Build a better config object 
- Make JSON Readable
- Nice prints
- Unit Tests
